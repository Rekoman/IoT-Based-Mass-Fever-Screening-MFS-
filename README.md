# IoT-Based-Mass-Fever-Screening-MFS-
This project was done as part of my final year project at my university, UCSI University, Malaysia.
This is an open source project.

This research proposes a device capable of automatically detecting and monitoring the elevated body temperatures
from the thermal image with less human interactions using an effective thermal sensor solution
that can be incorporated into an IoT-based Mass Fever Screening ‘MFS’ system which will help in detecting who has fever, 
which is a high potential symptom for detecting viral infections.
A thermal camera technology is used in the proposed design and integrated with an IoT technology
for tracking of the screening process to record the real time data and take the necessary action when an infected person is suspected,
by triggering an action such as a panic alarm or sending a notification or an email. Furthermore,
the proposed device is fitted with facial recognition software, and it will automatically take temperatures of the visitors.
